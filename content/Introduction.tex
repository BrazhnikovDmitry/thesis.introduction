%\section*{Abstract}
%The surface and interior wave motions interact with the sea bottom irregularities altering gravity 
%wave energy propagation. Directional scattering and mode conversion will inevitably reshape a wave 
%field and will impel restructure of localized energy budgets. Here three geophysically important 
%cases are investigated: (1) a tsunami wave scattering from a prominent sea mount, (2) origination 
%of a semidiurnal internal tide and (3) reflection of the internal tide from a continental slope. 
%These problems are investigated by means of numerical experiments and theoretical analysis.\\
%A tsunami wave is scattered by Koko Guoyt such that amplified and delayed signals were observed 
%during recent tsunami events. The numerical simulations emphasize complicated response. The energy 
%focusing occurs in dependence to tsunami incidence angel and frequencies involved. Koko guoyt as 
%having asymmetrical shape selectively amplifies tsunami wave frequency. The provided theoretical 
%analysis further outlines regions and parameters which would lead to higher amplification.\\
%Internal tides originate from surface tide interaction with steep submarine ridges. This phenomena 
%undergoes temporal variation leading to nonstationarity in the far field. It is shown for Tasman 
%Sea that remote internal tide modulates magnitude of energy conversion. Further leading to spatial 
%variability many kilometers away.\\
%The Tasman Sea internal tides impinge on the continental slope partially reflecting. The 
%reflectance markedly depends on generation of along slope leaky mode. Under some conditions 
%coupling with the surface tide occurs leading to overall energy increase (additional source?) that 
%outgoing energy becomes larger than incident amount. This deviates from classical two dimensional 
%view on reflection/scattering process of the internal tides. The presented estimates of energy 
%transfers further emphasize large variability mainly coming from along slope topography 
%inhomogeneity.\\
%Results for the problems conspicuously show importance of three dimensional topographic structure 
%in order to describe wave energy propagation. This has strong effect on variability in the

\section{Introduction}
Oceanic gravity waves fundamentally contribute to the redistribution of mechanical energy in the 
world ocean. The wave transmission can be altered as a result of interaction with large scale 
sea bottom features such as submarine mountains, trenches and continental slopes. This 
redistributes energy, causes wave reflection or might transform wave structure. In this work, by 
means of numerical simulations, these processes are examined for tsunamis and internal waves of 
tidal frequency (internal tides) for realistic cases of their interaction with ocean's bottom 
relief.\\
Tsunamis are transient waves that are impulsively forced by submarine earthquakes. The waves 
traverse vast expanses of the oceans and encounter numerous sea bottom features 
\citep{mofjeld2001tsunami}. In each instance, scattering redirects portion of incident energy. This 
process in case of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain and Hess Rise leads to highly variable 
spatio-temporal tsunami impact on coastal regions \citep{kowalik2008kuril, tang2012direct}. First, 
this is characterized by wave trains arriving in irregular sequence. The largest waves can 
unexpectedly appear with a several hour delay after the initial arrival 
\citep{koshimura2008effect}. At second, the overall wave intensity can markedly change along 
shoreline \citep{Borrero2013}. The problem is investigated in the Chapter 1. Scattering by Koko 
Guyot, the largest submarine seamount in the Emperor chain (Figure 1), is studied in order to 
quantify for the observed far-field signals in two recent tsunami events: the 2006 Kuril and 2011 
Tohoku-oki tsunamis.\\
The second problem considered in this dissertation explores internal waves that pervade ocean's 
interior. Their existence depends upon water column stratification since these waves manifest as an 
oscillatory motion of isopycnal surfaces. The initial perturbation can be forced by different 
mechanisms: wind stress \citep{garrett2001near}, buoyancy flux \citep{garrett1979internal}, ice 
ridge keels \citep{morison1986internal} or even tsunami \citep{santek2007satellite}. Additionally, 
tidal currents at steep topography can excite internal waves. These are baroclinic waves 
that oscillate with tidal and are called internal or baroclinic tides.\\
One reason to study baroclinic tides is their role in the dissipation of barotropic (surface) tidal 
energy \citep{munk1997once}. Current estimates suggest that 1/3 of total tidal energy is 
converted into internal motions in the deep ocean \citep{egbert2000significant}. From this roughly 
1/3 is directly lost to turbulent mixing right at generation sites \citep{st2002role} while the 
rest is emitted as freely propagating waves in form of tight beams \citep{simmons2004tidally}. 
These structures are observed to cross the ocean basins without much attenuation 
\citep{zhao2016global}. This finding fuels scientific research to understand where and how the 
baroclinic tidal energy is dissipated. Since the deposition sites primarily would occur deep below 
direct wind influence, the internal tides are thought to be a candidate for providing mechanical 
energy to close the upwelling branch of the Meridional overturning circulation 
\citep{munk1998abyssal}. Regardless of global importance, the baroclinic tides are relevant for 
local processes such as water mass transformation \citep{stigebrandt1989vertical}, vertical 
nutrient fluxes \citep{sharples2007spring}, sediment \citep{hotchkiss1982internal} and larvae 
transports \citep{pineda1999circulation}. All of the above is crucially dependent on an efficiency 
of energy removal in the process of internal-tide generation, propagation and scattering. 
And the respective parameterization is in a premature state to have a practical use.\\
In the setting of the Tasman Sea, an internal tidal beam originates at Macquarie Ridge and impinges 
on the continental slope of Tasmania (Figure 1). The Tidal Dissipation Experiment (TTIDE) had its 
goal to provide description of the internal tide reflection and involved energy lost. This means to 
quantify amount of wave energy being reflected back into open sea, converted into higher vertical 
modes and consequently, describe processes associated with sink of energy. These are the problems 
addressed in Chapters 2 and 3.\\
The two geophysical problems examined in the dissertation represent wave scattering by 
inhomogeneity in propagation media. Here, it takes form of rapid change in ocean depth imposing 
constrains on fluid motion. The accompanying transfers are intrinsically linked to energy flux 
approach. This is reviewed in \textbf{Section 2} of the Introduction by considering a normal mode 
dynamics, while \textbf{Section 3} describes energy characteristics associated with wave 
transformations caused by interaction with bathymetry.\\

%physically based mixing parametrization

%Consequently, this provides insight for future parametrization 
%of internal tide reflection that would allow for energetically constrained internal wave 
%models (e.g. \citep{eden2014energy}.

%\textit{At such location the energy would drain into perturbations of isopycnals that further can travel hundreds of  leagues without any significant loss of energy. In the second part of my thesis origination, propagation and dissipation of the internal tidal beam is investigated on the example of Tasman Sea.\\
%A global internal tide model, satellite altimetry measurements and in situ observations indicate that a ridge south of New Zealand is a site for the generation of the strong tidal beam that is directed towards the Tasman Shelf break. The low mode internal wave beam undergoes scattering from topography, which transfers energy to shorter length scales. Thus, understanding of local energy processes will lead to a more detailed picture of tidal energy dissipation.\\
%\textbf{PLUGIN: 2 TW, 1 TW, Macquarie Ridge, internal tides produce transport of particulates: sediments and can cause strong currents in deep ocean. Role in tidal dissipation, Internal tides what became apparent recently are important energy transporters.}

\section{Normal modes in a flat-bottom sea}
Tsunami and internal tides are long gravity waves. Their typical wavelengths are order of 
100 km being larger than the ocean's mean depth. Thus, the wave dynamics can be well described 
under the linear, hydrostatic framework. As a first step, wave propagation in a flat-bottom ocean 
is discussed. The equations of motion in stratified, Boussinesq ocean on an f-plane 
\citep{kundu2008fluid, cushman2011introduction} will take mathematical form of
\begin{subequations}
	\label{In:Beq}
	\begin{align}
	\pder[u]{t} - f v = -\frac{1}{\ib{\rho}_0}\pder[p]{x}\\
	\pder[v]{t} + f u = -\frac{1}{\ib{\rho}_0}\pder[p]{y}\\
	0 = -\pder[p]{z} - \rho g\\
	N^2 w = -\frac{1}{\ib{\rho}_0} \pderr[p]{z}{t}\\
	\pder[u]{x} + \pder[v]{y} + \pder[w]{z} = 0
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $(u,~v,~w)$ are velocity along zonal, meridional and vertical axis, $f$ is the Coriolis 
parameter, $p$ - perturbation pressure arising either from sea level oscillations or isopycnal 
displacements within stratified water column measured by Brunt-Vaisala frequency $N^2 = 
-\frac{g}{\ib{\rho}_0}\pder[\rho_0]{z}$. Additionally, boundary conditions are imposed on the 
surface and bottom,
\begin{align}
w|_{z = 0} = \pder[\zeta]{t},~p|_{z = 0} = \ib{\rho}_0 g \zeta\\
w|_{z = -H} = 0\label{In:bc.swe}
\end{align}
Both conditions are of linear form since the sea level motions are much smaller than the 
acceleration due to gravity, and the ocean depth is fixed. This formulation allows a solution via 
separation of vertical motions by employing following decomposition,
\begin{align}
(u, v, p)(x,y,z,t) = \sum_{n = 0} [u_n(x,y,t), v_n(x,y,t), p_n(x,y,t)]\psi_n(z)\\
w(x,y,z,t) = \sum_{n = 0} [w_n(x,y,t)] \int_{-H}^z \psi_n(z) dz\\
\rho(x,y,z,t) = \sum_{n = 0} [\rho_n(x,y,t)] \frac{d \psi_n(z)}{dz}
\end{align}
Upon substitution into \eqref{In:Beq} Sturm-Liouville problem is obtained for vertical structure 
(basis) functions $\psi_n(z)$\footnote{note this is for horizontal variables, usually it is written 
for vertical velocity since boundary conditions are expressed right away},
%\pder[\frac{1}{N^2 - \omega^2} \pder[\psi_n]{z}]{z} + \big(1 - \frac{f^2}{\omega^2} \big) \frac{\psi_n}{c^2_n} = 0
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dz}\big( \frac{1}{N^2} \frac{d \psi_n}{dz} \big) + \frac{1}{c^2_n}\psi_n = 0
\end{equation}
with an eigenvalue $c_n$ for a respective $n$-th vertical mode. $c_n$ is the wave phase speed in a 
non-rotating ocean with an equivalent depth, $D_n$ such that $\sqrt{g D_n} = c_n$. The 
decomposition separates vertical motions from horizontal dynamics reducing the initial set 
\eqref{In:Beq} to the Laplace tidal equations,
\begin{subequations}
\label{In:sweq}
\begin{align}
%\begin{split}
\pder[\vec{u}_n]{t} + f \vec{k} \times \vec{u}_n = -\frac{1}{\rho_0} \nabla p_n \label{In:swe.mom}\\
\frac{1}{\rho_0} \pder[p_n]{t} + g D_n \nabla  \cdot \vec{u}_n = 0 \label{In:swe.cont}
%\end{split}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
This reveals the dynamical equivalence between barotropic, surface wave and baroclinic, internal 
waves if the ocean stratification were absent and the depth was $D_n$. In actuality, $0$-th mode 
represents a barotropic solution with vertically uniform dynamics ($\psi_0 = const$) 
and the depth $D_0 \simeq H$ \citep{hendershott1981long}. The gravest mode represents pure surface 
wave propagation such as in the tsunami wave problem. The infinite sequence of higher vertical 
modes are internal modes that produce increasingly negligible sea level perturbations. This allows 
complete separation between barotropic and baroclinic motions which is similar to imposing rigid 
lid condition on internal modes \citep{kundu2008fluid}.\\
The main interest is in linear wave phenomena, so harmonic temporal behavior, $e^{i \omega t}$ 
will be implied leading to the Helmholtz equation,
\begin{align}
\label{In:helmeq}
(\omega^2 - f^2) p_n + c_n^2 \Delta p_n = 0
\end{align}
Making a plane wave ansatz, $e^{-i\vec{k} \cdot \vec{x}}$, currents and pressure will be related as
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
p_n = p_{0n} e^{i (\omega t - \vec{k} \cdot \vec{x})}\\
u_n = \frac{1}{\ib{\rho}_0} \frac{\omega k_x + i f k_y}{\omega^2 - f^2} p_n\\
v_n = \frac{1}{\ib{\rho}_0} \frac{\omega k_y - i f k_x}{\omega^2 - f^2} p_n
\end{split}
\end{align}
Then from \eqref{In:swe.cont}, a dispersion relation for Sverdrup waves follows,
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = f^2 + c^2_n |\vec{k}|^2
\end{equation}
The waves are dispersive as a result of Earth's rotation, with phase and group speeds are
\begin{align}
c_{p} = (1 - \frac{f^2}{\omega^2})^{-1/2} c_n,~c_g = (1 - \frac{f^2}{\omega^2})^{1/2} c_n,~c_p c_g 
= c_n^2
\end{align}
For the most energetic mode-1 semidiurnal internal tide and typical ocean conditions phase travels 
with speed of $4~m/s$, but group speed is only $2~m/s$. So slow traveling wave is potentially 
affected by background oceanic circulation. On contrary, tsunami waves exhibit shallow-water, 
nondispersive behavior with phase and group speeds of $\sim O(100~m/s)$ owing to small periods in 
comparison to inertial period. Tsunami waves cross ocean basins in a matter of hours without any 
appreciable interaction with ocean's dynamical state.\\
In the deep ocean, where the bottom topography does not demonstrate large spatial gradients, normal 
modes are useful to describe wave dynamics. An energy equation can be developed from 
\eqref{In:sweq}. Multiplying the momentum equations by $\vec{u}_n$ and the continuity equation by 
$p_n$, adding both expressions and depth integrating one obtains
\begin{equation}
(E_k + E_p)_t + \nabla \cdot \vec{F} = 0 \label{In:eneq}
\end{equation}
Additionally, depth averaging is carried out so that energy flux will be defined,
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}_n = \frac{1}{H} \vec{u}_n(t) p_n(t) \int_{-H}^0 \psi^2(z) dz \label{In:fldef}
\end{equation}
For tsunami wave propagation due to their barotropic nature $\psi(z) = const$ and $p_n = \rho_0 g 
\eta$, the expression takes its classical form for surface wave propagation 
\citep{henry2001representation}, $\vec{F} = \rho_0 g \vec{u} \zeta$.\\
In internal tide studies period averaging further simplifies calculations,
\begin{align}
\vec{F}_n = \frac{1}{2H} \cj{\vec{u}}_n p_n \int_{-H}^0 \psi^2(z) dz
\end{align}
where velocity and baroclinic pressure are now complex amplitudes of harmonic fit and $\cj{}$ is a 
complex conjugate.\\
The obtained expressions for energy flux comprises only the pressure-work term, i.e. transport of 
energy is dictated by pressure forces. In full formulation this is augmented with nonlinear 
contributions made by advection and dissipative forces \citep{gill2016atmosphere}. These terms 
are negligible presuming deep ocean propagation where the wave's spatial dimensions are large and 
magnitude of dynamical variables is small.\\
%\citep{kang2012energetics}, \citep{nash2012unpredictable}
Away from scattering regions, an energy budget can be constructed following the linearized normal 
mode dynamics. Any loss in intensity of primary wave has to be balanced by energy scattered into 
other form of motion such as vertical modes or trapped waves and by dissipative losses. The latter 
is not discussed here and thought to constitute a residue term. The scattered wave field, 
reflected components and intermodal conversion are the main topic of investigation. The 
quantitative aspects are discussed in \textbf{Section 3}.\\

\section{Oceanic wave scattering}
The wave scattering in the ocean can be defined in the same manner as for sound waves 
\citep{Lighthill2001}. The scattered component are said to be a difference between two wave fields:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the disturbed field when the inhomogeneity such as topography is present;
	\item the field when the inhomogeneity is absent, so that it is described by the incident wave 
	only.
\end{itemize}
The difference arises solely because of the full bottom boundary condition,
\begin{equation}
( \vec{u} \cdot \nabla h )|_{z = -h(x, y)} = 0~\text{or}~w = - \vec{u}_h \cdot \nabla h 
\label{In:bcnon} 
\end{equation}
The condition states that there is no mass transport across an impermeable bottom. The wave motion 
cannot alone satisfy (\ref{In:bcnon}), and a compensating flow has to develop to preserve mass. For 
instance, when an incident wave train encounters a vertical wall in a nonrotating ocean, a 
specular reflection occurs in order to fulfill the no-flow condition.\\
An additional condition is imposed on scattered waves such that the energy vanishes with distance 
\citep{mei1989theory, morse1946methods, olbers1981formal}. The Sommerfeld radiation condition leads 
to a far-field asymptotic on a horizontal plane:
\begin{equation}
\label{In:def.scamp}
p_{scat} \sim \frac{e^{i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{x}}}{|\vec{x}|} \Phi_s (\theta)
\end{equation}
This is an assertion for circularly spreading waves having some angular distribution $\Phi_s$, 
called a scattering amplitude.\\
In the near-field, a scattered wave field can be decomposed by Fourier transform whereby each 
wavenumber can be regarded as a separate component. As it propagates away, it will begin to 
separate from others. Magnitude modulations due to interference \footnote{more appropriate to say 
diffraction} will subdue. And at large distances, respective Fourier coefficient will represent a 
scattering amplitude in direction corresponding to the wave vector. As a result, Fourier transform 
depicts the far-field's distribution of energy.\\
This comprises the general idea behind scattering phenomena. Since in this work two types of 
wave motions are dealt with, an additional comments that are specific to each type follows.

\subsection{Tsunami wave scattering}
Since tsunamis are typical long, barotropic waves, the full nonlinear boundary condition can be 
incorporated into \eqref{In:swe.cont} to produce
\begin{equation}
\pder[\eta]{t} + \nabla  \cdot (H \vec{u}) = 0 
\end{equation}
When a tsunami encounters a topography, a flow convergence due to a sloping bottom will 
cause localized reflection and reorientation of the motion. As a result,the topography will emit 
radially spreading waves. And the disturbed field will have an angular distribution distinct from 
the initial wave. Then the scattering amplitude will constitute a primary characteristic in the 
tsunami-topography interaction \footnote{\citep{vastano1973transient, saito2009scattering}}.\\
Because of tsunami's transient nature, the interaction will also transfer energy into trapped 
motions \citep{longuet1967trapping, tinti1995tsunami}. They usually thought as standing 
waves\footnote{ or ``sloshing modes"} associated with a topography's shape or as edge waves 
confined to a slope. Such transient trapped waves do significantly contribute to local 
oscillations as slowly re-emitted energy leaks into the open ocean, but in the far-field this will 
not have appreciable effect.\\
For long waves it is usually possible to omit a topography variation by considering it to be a 
depth discontinuity. Then a seamount, such as Koko Guyot, will be analogous to a cylinder. An error 
of such representation decreases as $O(k^2 H^2)$ \citep{mei1989theory}, for typical mean ocean 
depth's of 4000 m and wave periods longer than 10 minutes, the above simplification is valid. In 
this case, nonlinear problem of \eqref{In:bcnon} is similar to fulfilling so-called matching 
conditions. These are mass conservation and continuity of sea level
\begin{align}
\vec{u}_1 h_1 = \vec{u}_2 h_2,~\zeta_1 = \zeta_2
\end{align}

\subsection{Internal tide scattering}
In the internal tide problem, in addition to the spatial energy redistribution, there could occur a 
transfer of energy into different vertical modes which is usually termed scattering in internal 
tide literature \citep[e.g.][]{muller1992scattering}. Let us consider a long wave that obeys 
Laplace tidal equations entering a region where bottom slope is inclined and the full boundary 
condition \eqref{In:bcnon} has to be satisfied. It only can be fulfilled if there is a vertical 
velocity. A normal mode by itself is not able to represent the dynamics since the vertical 
derivative, by definition, is zero on the boundary. However, a superposition of modes can force 
horizontal convergence to cancel out the vertical velocity. Physically, pressure gradients should 
develop by displacing isopycnal surfaces which further radiate energy away in the form of 
baroclinic modes. In general, this describes a coupled-mode approach \citep{griffiths2007internal}. 
Locally-flat normal modes counteract one another through the boundary condition. The spatial 
gradients will dictate mode's magnitude to ensure a balance. Dynamically, Laplace tidal equation 
for each separate mode will embrace an additional force represented as an intermodal-coupling term 
\citep{griffiths2007internal, kelly2016coupled}.\\
The intermodal conversion and energy flux carried by modes can be estimated as work done by 
vertical velocity against modal pressure, $W_{m \to n} \sim (w_{m,~scat}~p_n)|_{z = 
-h} = -((\vec{u}_m \cdot \nabla h) p_n)|_{z = -h}$. But total conversion must as well account for 
the opposite energy transfer, from $n$ to $m$, hence,
\begin{align}
\label{In:en.trans}
C_{m \to n} = -((\vec{u}_m \cdot \nabla h)~p_n)|_{z = -h} + ((\vec{u}_n \cdot \nabla h)~p_m)|_{z = 
-h}
\end{align}
Internal tide excitation can be viewed as scattering of barotropic tide by steep relief into higher 
(baroclinic) modes \citep{hendershott1981long}. If the surface tide is the $0^{th}$ mode, then 
energy lost can be diagnosed as
\begin{align}
\label{In:bt_bc}
C_{bt \to bc} = -(\vec{u}_{bt} \cdot \nabla h)~\sum_{n = 1} p_n|_{z = -h}
\end{align}
assuming that the baroclinic wave field effect on surface tide is negligible 
\citep{kelly2012cascade}. The above expression is well established in internal tide studies 
\citep{kurapov2003m, llewellyn2002conversion, pickering2015structure}.\\
For consideration of mode-1 scattering it is useful to reformulate \eqref{In:en.trans} by employing 
Leibniz's rule, the continuity equation per each normal mode, and mode's orthogonality,
\begin{align}
\label{In:bc_bc}
C_{m \to n} = \int_{-h}^{0} (u_m \nabla p_n - u_n \nabla p_m) dz
\end{align}
In the problem of internal wave propagation over uniform and gently inclined bottom 
\citep{wunsch1968propagation}, there is no intermodal conversion, $C_{m \to n} = 0$, and each 
mode's dynamics is perfectly matched by presence of others. Strictly speaking, in this case the 
wave equation is hyperbolic \footnote{(in contrary to elliptical Helmholtz equation, 
\eqref{In:helmeq})} and propagation occurs along characteristics \citep{sandstrom1969effect} or 
internal wave rays described by
\begin{equation}
\label{In:ch.angle}
\gamma = \frac{dz}{dx} = \pm \frac{\omega^2 - f^2}{N^2 - \omega^2}
\end{equation}
Slope criticality can be defined as ratio between bottom gradient and rays angle, $\gamma$. In 
the subcritical regime of forward propagation, the ratio is less than unity. In this regime a 
more inclined bottom requires a greater number of modes to describe internal tide dynamics (Figure 
2). Now it is apparent that a mode conversion will not happen, unless there is a change in 
topography to drive adjustment of mode amplitudes. In contrast, in the supercritical regime, when 
$\nabla h > \gamma$, internal waves are always reflected with increase of higher mode contribution. 
Usually, they will be phase-locked into vertically propagating rays \citep{garrett2007internal, 
lamb2014internal} subject to breaking and dissipation \citep{lien2001observations, 
nash2004internal, klymak2011breaking}. In case of the continental slope this causes internal tide 
mode-1 reflection to decrease relative to the equivalent case of surface wave reflection.\\
A similar to the tsunami problem simplification can be made by representing a topography as a depth 
jump \citep{st2002role, larsen1969internal, chapman1981scattering}. \footnote{Should I mention no 
justification?} Now the matching conditions will require continuity of pressure across the 
jump and no momentum transport through vertical walls:
\begin{align}
p_1 = p_2, -h_2 \leq z \leq 0 \\
\vec{u}_1 = 0, -h_1 \leq z \leq -h_2\\
\vec{u}_1 = \vec{u}_2, -h_2 \leq z \leq 0
\end{align}

%In overall, this thesis intends to investigate scattering process in three geophysical cases. In order to study this phenomena one will inevitably encounter interference which can lead to impossibility of direct energy budget estimates. Here I concerned with obtaining characteristics of how much energy was lost and how that energy was distributed in space. So decomposition of interference into elemental waves should be considered.\\
%I address this question by studying results of numerous numerical experiments with varying conditions. Hence, inconstancy of the tidal beam characteristics and its intertwine with topography and background conditions could be quantitatively described in order for better explanation of TTIDE field measurements.

%occurring 
%Energy conservation, \eqref{In:eneq} sets an useful framework for analysis of the wave interaction 
%with topography. As bottom slope starts rapidly change, wave propagation undergoes variation 
%resulting in reorientation of currents, divergence in water column. But because of energy 
%conservation, amount of total energy should be preserved. Hence, energy transports of energy 
%through control volumes can present a valuable tool for description of wave interaction with 
%bottom 
%relief. The approach 
%
%I deliberately abandon nonlinear terms . Koko Guoyt depth on 
%average is around 500 m, barotropic velocity is of order $0.1~m/s$, nonlinear terms scale as $\sim 
%u^3$, while linear energy flux as $\sim g u \zeta$. It suggests that only in shallow water where 
%horizontal acceleration is of order of gravity acceleration, nonlinear terms will be a significant 
%addition to total energy transports. The same discussion on nonlinear additions stays true for 
%internal tide scattering from the Tasman continental slope which depth does not exceed $100~m$. 
%Only on shallow shelfs advection of kinetic energy becomes non-negligible
